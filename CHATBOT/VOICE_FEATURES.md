# Voice Features Documentation

## 🎤 Voice Input (Speech-to-Text)

The chatbot includes a microphone button that allows users to speak their questions instead of typing.

### How It Works

1. **Click the microphone button** in the input area
2. **Speak your question** clearly
3. The spoken words are **automatically converted to text**
4. The text appears in the input field
5. You can then send it or edit it before sending

### Browser Support

- ✅ **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- ✅ **Safari**: Full support (macOS/iOS)
- ⚠️ **Firefox**: Limited support (may require additional setup)

### Language Support

- **English**: Uses `en-US` language code
- **Malayalam**: Uses `ml-IN` language code

The speech recognition automatically uses the language you selected when opening the chatbot.

### Tips for Best Results

- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Minimize background noise
- Ensure your microphone permissions are granted
- Wait for the microphone button to show "Listening..." status
